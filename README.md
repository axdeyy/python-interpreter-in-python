# python-interpreter-in-python
A Python interpreter, written in Python.

To start with, the plan is to implement a fully functional interpreter for a very small subset of Python e.g
- Arithmetic operations
- Variable assignments and lookups
- Simple output: `print`
- Input handling: `input`

Currently working on executor
